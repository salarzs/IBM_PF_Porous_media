The code is a custom-built CFD solver for simulating two-phase incompressible flow in porous media using a fully Eulerian framework. It solves the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations coupled with a Cahn–Hilliard phase-field model to capture the interface between immiscible fluids. The governing equations are discretized on a Cartesian staggered grid using a second-order finite-volume scheme, and advanced in time using a second-order Adams–Bashforth method. Pressure–velocity coupling is handled with a fractional-step projection method.
For boundary conditions, the code integrates a volume-penalization immersed boundary method to enforce no-slip and no-penetration on complex solid geometries, and uses a ghost-cell method to impose dynamic contact angles and slip conditions at solid surfaces. The interface dynamics and wettability effects are modeled without empirical contact line treatments, relying on the inherent regularization of the diffuse-interface formulation.
The code is parallelized using MPI, designed for high-resolution simulations in 2D geometries, and has been previously validated against benchmark problems for interface tracking and wettability-controlled flow through complex domains.
